# Apache Iceberg

It feels like just a few years ago I was learning about MapReduce and Hadoop.

Now companies like Facebook and Netflix have made major improvements to how to store and process data.

One of those major improvements is table formats.

In particular, Iceberg was created at Netflix to improve several limitations of how Hive was storing data.

But honestly. What in the world is Iceberg?
